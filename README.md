# JSON Loader

This is a BepInEx plugin made for Incryption to create custom cards, encounters, and regions using JSON files and the API by Cyantist.
It can parse custom cards, encounters, and regions, passing them to APIPlugin to load them into the game.

## Converting Existing Cards

In order to have compatability with mod manager, version 1.7.0 breaks backwards compatability. Don't worry though! all the contents of your files are fine, the only change is the extension on the end. the new extension JSONLoader looks for is .jldr, so you'll need to start making cards with that extension instead of .json (again, the **contents** are still in the json format). If you have a lot of cards to change, you can use the json to jldr [converter utility](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/JSONRenameUtility/) to convert all cards in a directory from .json to .jldr!

## Installation

### Automatic
Simply download with Thunderstore Mod Manager!

### Manual
To install this plugin you first need to install BepInEx as a mod loader for Inscryption. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html#where-to-download-bepinex)

You will also need version 1.13+ of the [InscryptionAPI](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionAPI) plugin.

Finally, you simply need to put the **JSONLoader.dll** folder in **BepInEx/plugins**.

## Custom Cards

To create your own cards you just create a .jldr file (written in JSON) with the '\_card' postfix *(e.g. MyCard_card.jldr)* and fill in all the fields you want your card to have (fields you don't include will be defaulted). The *name* field is required, and the rest are optional with default values (though that would be a boring card). Those fields and their values are specified in the table below. For reference, an example custom card (NewCard_card_example.jldr) is included in the **Cards** folder in this repo.

To edit existing cards, you similarly create a .jldr file and fill in the fields you want to edit on the card. You must include both the *name* field and the *fieldsToEdit* field with at least 1 field name in it (explained more on the table). Any fields you don't include in *fieldsToEdit* will not be changed from the base card.

You can use this [online JSON Schema validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/s/D3dmDn7L) to avoid syntax errors, and make sure the fields are correct in your json files.
There is also a [GUI](https://tinyurl.com/asxfrfbc) based verion that is an option, just copy the json from the right hand panel when done!

Files go anywhere in the plugins folder, along with the artwork required for the card.

Cards have lots of fields that can be filled - this is a list of all field names and their purpose. The fields you wish to include in the .jldr file should be copied exactly from this table, and any fields that refer to *Enums.md* or *Card Names.txt* should have their strings be copied exactly from there.

## Debugging
The easiest way to check if the plugin is working properly or to debug an error is to enable the console. This can be done by changing
```
[Logging.Console]
\## Enables showing a console for log output.
\# Setting type: Boolean
\# Default value: false
Enabled = false
```
to
```
[Logging.Console]
\## Enables showing a console for log output.
\# Setting type: Boolean
\# Default value: false
Enabled = true
```
in **Inscryption/BepInEx/Config/BepInEx.cfg**
